(00:00) this video is made possible thanks to invido AI more details coming up soon the US economy has achieved an incredible level of growth since the end of the pandemic however Uncle Sam's achievements have been so great that they have eclipsed those of the other great North American power Canada the Canadian economy has always been characterized as a well-oiled engine its GDP has grown at much higher rates than most countries in the G7 not content with this Canada was also one of the first countries to recover from the 2020 crisis who do we have to thank for this unexpected Triumph and were the policies of Justin Trudeau's government
(00:34) the key to overcoming the crisis well probably not the truth is that long before the progressives came to power Canada had a reputation as an economy Untouchable by economic downturns abroad an example of this occurred in 2008 where their GDP suffered much smaller declines than those of their counterparts in the G7 regardless of whether the right or left governs the Canadian economy seems to be going like a rocket improving year after year and does not seem particularly affected by the problems of other nations nevertheless if our visual economic team is making a video on this topic it's because things have started to go ay
(01:06) what's more if you were to talk to a Canadian right now and tell him or her that Canada is one of the most prosperous in the world they would probably laugh in your face the reason well wealth per person has been stagnant for several years its GDP per capita has had one of the most disappointing performances of almost any developed country over the last decade even lagging behind other troubled Nations such as the United Kingdom even worse during 2023 last year real GDP per capita collapsed by almost 2% relative to 2022 in other words a full blown recession so the questions are clear why is the Canadian economy in Decline what

(03:37) before pointing to immigrants as the cause of all the ills of the Canadian Nation let's keep in mind that there are other countries where this is not the case cases like Singapore or Hong Kong show that an economy can welcome thousands of people every year without harming income and this is exactly where the problem lies the Canadian economy has not grown as much as it should have if we look at the data most of the GDP growth in recent years has been due to the increase in workers that is the arrival of immigrants meanwhile productivity improvements have virtually disappeared in other words the Canadian economy has not been able to take full
(04:10) advantage of its potential or at least not as much as other countries have done the question is why to understand why we must first ask ourselves when the problem started because until 1980 Canadian productivity levels were almost on a par with those of the United States however it was from then on that things went downhill what happened starting in the 198 80s to cause Canadian productivity to plummet well let's take it one step at a time a productive economy requires large amounts of investment the acquisition of machines computers Network infrastructure in other words elements that allow us to produce more and earn
(04:47) more money economists call this process capital accumulation and it's one of the main reasons why modern societies have been able to raise their living standards so dramatically over the past 200 years the question is how is the current in investment situation in Canada well the news speaks for itself ottawa's disinterest in entrepreneurship and business investment hurting economy the Canadian economy lacks entrepreneurs who are willing to put their savings on the line in order to grow their businesses among developed economies Canada stands out as having one of the smallest and most timid business sectors
(05:20) of all with private investment at less than 50% and do you know the worst part it's no longer just that local companies are not willing to invest it's that foreign investment is heading the same way Jack Mintz Canada has lost $225 billion in foreign investments since 2016 since 2000 foreign Capital inflows have plummeted from more than 9% of GDP to less than 3% this decline in investment both domestic and foreign is one of the key factors behind Canada's decline but how could this happen in Canada one of the world's largest economies and why are investors including those from the neighboring United States no longer interested in
(05:58) the north the answer unfortunately is a classic overregulation state interventionism is nothing new to put it nicely regulations are like a blanket of snow in small amounts it's lovely but when there is a lot it becomes annoying and if there's too much it even becomes dangerous and in the snowy land of Canada regulations have become just that dangerous Canada is by far one of the countries most closed to foreign investment in the world its level of restrictiveness is so great that it's almost three times the average of the entire OBC and easily surpasses even the United States Japan and France put together paperwork approvals
(06:37) licenses fees permits taxes on everything you can imagine the bureaucratic and fiscal framework is so asphyxiating that it has managed to destroy incentives for investment but do you want an example take the dairy and poultry Supply Management in Canada this system limits the amount of products farmers can produce through quota control which keeps prices high and prevents free trade and then there are many more regulations like this one the result according to a paper by the international monetary fund bureaucratic barriers to internal trade between provinces alone cost as much as a 20% barrier to Imports for each province in
(07:11) other words the Canadian state is so vast and so bureaucratic that its own territories act as a market more closed than the European Union but there's more it's no longer just that investment is low is that the investment that does exist is not directed at exploiting the best opportunities aail available on the one hand Canada is one of the lowest Spenders on research and development in the G7 surpassing only Italy which is not the most prosperous economy in the world either on the other hand the Canadian economy has undergone an unprecedented process of de-industrialization since the early 2000s its manufacturing sector which is
(07:47) one of the highest value added parts of any economy has come to represent less than 10% of GDP whereas it accounted for 17% 20 years ago at the end of the day if you had a company and the state came and took most of your profits didn't let you invest and on top of that put absurd regulations for everything you did would you take risks in some ultra competitive market like technology or would you prefer to stay in sectors with less potential but more security well high value sectors are not thriving hardly anyone in Canada wants to risk their money to go into artificial intelligence or industry so much so that the
(08:20) country's share of high-tech exports has deteriorated sharply since the 2008 crisis a time when government regulations and investment restrictions began to become increasingly pervasive now what if I told you that not all the blame for this decline lies with the Canadian [Music] government in Canada there's another major problem that has prevented it from competing and adapting the talent drain being neighbors of the United States Canadians have access to one of the most competitive labor markets in the world and of course High salaries in Canada pale in comparison to their us counterparts especially for high level
(08:55) professions such as surgeons or Engineers to give you an idea last year according to Canan Canadian Census Data only 10,415 Americans arrived in Canada but 126,50 40 Canadians moved South of the Border and obviously all these people are not going to the US Just For Pleasure they are going for work better salaries promotion possibilities and even lower taxes make the possibility of migrating South a desirable career Prospect the outcome Canadian companies are being left with the crumbs and the best professionals trained right in Canada are leaving the country ultimately Canada's business sector has been eroded over the past few decades by
(09:34) massive amounts of government interventionism regulation and Taxation that have left the country's productivity levels in the doldrums if Canada wants to get out of the crisis and grow by more than just its GDP then it will have to improve this bottleneck situation in its capital accumulation cycle but until it does that it's time to hear your thoughts do you think Canadian productivity will be able to break out of its downward Trend and are you confident that the government will be able to find solutions to the problem s don't forget to leave us your answers Below in the comment box and also don't
